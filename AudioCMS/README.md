# Audio Reporting Portal Web CMS 
The project is based on Java EE SSH framework. This project has implemented an establishment of a portal web CMS, and it can be also used for portal web template. This project has fully taken advantage of the audio combination of the AIP from Baidu Cloud (Computing) in order to realize the audio reporting feature of the articles. Click the plat button in the front article and you can listen to the audio report of the article, and get the information without reading with eyes. The frontend of the project has fully taken advantage of the features of HTML5 and CSS3 in order to set type (You should modify the type if using for templates). What is used in the publishing articles page is KindEditor, and this is also used for upload files, with the JSP provided. The database used by this project is MySQL. The entire project and all its business logics are devoloped by myself except the SSH framework JARs and audio combination JAR/audio combination server.
